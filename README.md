I'm a 12th-grade student of Software Engineering Vocational High School with a 6-month internship in software development. I has an organizational background as the Student Council President, accustomed to working in teams, leading, and strategizing. I had a passion for design and an interest in data science and cyber security, evident in my experience managing online datasets for visualization and analysis. I also had worked on several website and mobile app projects, with a focus on development, design, and team collaboration.
